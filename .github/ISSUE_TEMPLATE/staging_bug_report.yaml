        ## Short Note to QA Testers
        This note outlines the required format and criteria for entering bugs into the Masterji Staging Bugs document.

        ### Bug Entry Format
        Please enter all functional bugs using an unordered list format. Each bug should be a distinct list item.

        **Example:**
        User is unable to save their profile after making changes to the 'About Me' section.
        The system allows creation of a new entry without required fields being populated.
        Upon submission, the form clears the entered data instead of navigating to the confirmation page.

        ### Criteria for Bug Submission
        Only functional bugs should be reported.

        Acceptable: A feature is broken, a transaction fails, data integrity is compromised, or a workflow cannot be completed.
        Unacceptable (unless breaking functionality): Visual alignment issues, color discrepancies, font issues, or padding/margin problems.

        Exception: You may report a UI-related bug only if it is actively breaking the functionality (e.g., a button is visually obscured and cannot be clicked, or a required field is not displayed, etc).
